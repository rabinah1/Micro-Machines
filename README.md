# Micro-Machines

## General information

This program is a simple racing game inspired by the Micro Machines -game. This is a school project that I did during a course "C++ Programming" in a group of four people. My part of the project was to implement the file "Functions.cpp" (except for the function "EditorWindow" that I did not implement) and I also wrote a major part of the file "Main.cpp". All members of our group contributed quite equally to this project.

## Requirements for using the program

To use this program, you will need C++11, SFML- and Box2D-libraries. This program should work with one of the newest SFML- and Box2D-versions. This program has been tested only on Linux-environment.

## How to use the program

If you have the correct versions of SFML and Box2D installed, the program should compile by simply opening the command line and first typing "cmake ." and after that "make". Finally, to start the program, you should type "./main".
